# Mission Log: Session History

## Session Summary (Feb 2026)
This session focused on narrowing the project scope and solidifying the brand identity around the "Kinetic Clearing" theme.

### Major Objectives Completed:
- **Major Rebranding:** Transitioned all site references from "Bush Bodies" and "Base Camp" to "Kinetic Clearing."
- **Focus Refinement:** Removed the "Unbound Trekkers" section and "Everyday Carry" banners to streamline the user journey toward the core "Field Repair" action.
- **Hero Optimization:** Updated the hero section to prioritize the "Field Repair" Call-To-Action (CTA), removing secondary "Story" and "Join" buttons from the immediate landing view (while keeping them in the navigation).
- **Tooling Implementation:**
    - Developed the **Field Repair** interactive triage component with state-switched kit displays.
    - Designed the **Enrollment** ("Radio Silence Ends Here") section with a high-vis survival aesthetic.
- **Visual Standardization:** Established a site-wide image stylization protocol using high-contrast grayscale filters.

### Key Files Modified:
- `/app/page.tsx`: Main content structure and component logic.
- `/components/DynamicHeader.tsx`: Navigation logic and dynamic title tracking.
- `/tailwind.config.ts`: Added custom colors (`spruce`, `action`, `granite`, `yellow`).

### Current State:
The site is currently a high-impact, single-page landing experience ready for content expansion and backend integration for user enrollment. All visual assets are stylized, and the navigation is functionally tied to the content layout.
